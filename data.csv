We strive to divert books from landfills, help fund library sustainability and through our partners, provide meaningful solutions to the global problem of illiteracy.

We Believe:
Books are a timeless expression of discovery, imagination, and achievement. We let stories live on by ensuring books are read again, donated to someone in need, or recycled as another useful consumer good with a new story to tell. In doing so, we contribute to the sustainability of the environment, and the betterment of the communities in which we operate.

We Value:
· The environment, and we help protect it by ensuring unwanted books are sold or redistributed, not thoughtlessly destroyed.
· Literacy, so we donate books - millions of them - to literacy- and community-based organizations in the communities we serve.
· Library sustainability, through better inventory management and the creation of new revenue streams in support of library operations.
Job creation, through continued growth. – less",10
